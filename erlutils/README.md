erlutils
======

This subdirectory contains various utilities for Erlang.
They are taken from Joe Armstrongs' book on Erlang and Fred T.
Heberts' "Learn you some Erlang for great good".

What's included
---------------

**Makefile.erl.template**:

This is a template for Erlang Makefiles. It's pretty self-explaining and
documented well.

**tester**:

This implements a small utility that compiles Erlang tests and runs them.
Also it checks their output.

**pretty_print**:

This implements a small utility that creates nicely formatted Erlang code
from strings from, for example, the Erlang REPL.
