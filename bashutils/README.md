bashutils
=========

This directory has a few files in it that I regularly use.
I am not the biggest bash suer, so those tools are not from me.
Also, those are utilities for making programming more convenient,
so they are self-contained.

What's included
---------------

**erl_crashdump_analyzer**:

This one if from Fred H., the famous author of "Learn you some Erlang
for great good", a very good resource for beginner erlangers. It analyzes
the logfile a dying BEAM left behind and collects info about its state at 
the moment of dying. So you could easily call it a forensics tool for analyzing
the crash of a BEAM if you will.
