utilties
======

This repository contains utilities in various programming languages, mostly from 
programming books I read or talks I heard.

It is not the only repository out there that contains many of those utilities,
but my rewritten version are for private purposes anyway.

What's included
---------------

Most languages I use on a regular basis have a subdirectory here. Languages
I have a subdir for include:

1. C/C++ in *cutils*
2. Python in *pyutils*
3. Javascript in *jsutils*
4. Erlang in *erlutils*
5. Shell in *shutils*

I am sure there are more to come.
