pyutils
======

This repo includes many Python utilities, such as decorators, metaclasses,
descriptors and many other things to customize (and even break) your Python.

What's included
---------------

The Python code is documented pretty okay, so I will not explain it too verbosely
here:

**decorators**:

All kinds of decorator utilities. Some I have written myself, but most of them are
from talks I heard or code I read.

**breaking_python**:

All you need to make python a typechecking language that can import XML(by generating
class code from it). Do not use it. It's terrible, but way cool. It is from a three-hour
talk by (find out source).

**keywords**:

Really small file to check which strings are keywords in your Python version. I found that
while I wrote a syntax highlighter for a different project of mine.

**package_utils**:

Those are utilities which are mostly from MakeHuman, if I recall correctly. Those utilities
are mostly for versioning and making working with the packages' version number easy.
